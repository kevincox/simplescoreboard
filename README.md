# Simple Scoreboard

A simple html scoreboard.

q-w-e-r keys give player 1 5-10-15-20 points, and a-s-d-f give the same to
plater 2.  Hold shift to remove that many points.  p-l-, clear player 1, 2 and
both players scores.  And of course, no scoreboard would be complete without a
buzzer, hit b for that.
